# Questioners

Wanna know your classmates better? Now's your chance! You'll be asking one partner some questions, and they'll be asking you. Then we'll get together and share the results!

### Technologies Used

- REPL.it collaboration
- Markdown

### The Basics

1. You or your partner will creating a Markdown file (with a `.md` "file extension", i.e., your filename should end with that `.md`) in an HTML/CSS/JS REPL on [REPL.it](https://repl.it).
2. Whoever created it will invite/share (the button will say one of those two things) with the other so that you both can edit the Markdown file.
3. You will then _each_ ask the other five questions.
4. Make sure to include something from each of the requirements below!

### Requirements

- You should have a heading, that's a title for your page. (Up to you what the title is!)
- Your names should be on it as subheadings.
- All of your questions should be in a list of some kind, ordered or unordered (i.e., number or bullet list).
- You must include a link (could be to anywhere). Have fun with it!
- You must include an image.
